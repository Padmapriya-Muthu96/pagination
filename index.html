            <p>The historic Hindu temple of Meenakshi Amman is always busy with thousands of pilgrims from all across the country visiting the temple every day. The temple is located on the Vaigai River’s southern banks in Madurai, a city that is nicknamed as the Temple City. The temple is dedicated to Meenakshi, a form of Parvati, the consort of Lord Shiva. Other Hindu deities are also worshipped here. Although the temple is very ancient, it was expanded, reconstructed, repaired, and renovated a number of times in the past few centuries. In the 14th century, the Muslim Commander Malik Kafur plundered the temple with his armies. The Vijayanagara kings then rebuilt the temple. The 10-day long Meenakshi Tirukalyanam festival held at this temple attracts more than a million visitors to this temple each year. There is thus no wonder that the Meenakshi Temple is the number one of the Seven Wonders Of Tamil Nadu.</p>
